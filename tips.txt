	Tech Tip Customer requests HDD retention with SSR on site
	
	
	
	

Issue: SSR calls and states customer wants to retain HDD he replaced to 
recover data.

Process:  Call PCM (HDD Retention) 770-905-8071 and give answering rep CAD 
number and that you have an SSR with a customer requesting HDD retention.  
Conference in SSR and PCM rep will speak to them and the customer to 
explain the exception.  SSR will give return air bill and HDD to customer 
and close the call.  SSR is no longer responsible for HDD.

Process Ends.

TITLE:  
 
HDD LED status is incorrect in the RAID100 Configuration User Interface 
during RAID volume rebuilds
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
On the Lenovo ThinkServer TD340 system, when the RAID volume is degraded 
and an HDD is undergoing a rebuild if the user is viewing the RAID100 
configuration User Interface (entered by pressing “Ctrl+M” during POST), 
the LEDs on the HDDs not being rebuilt will be solid on instead of 
blinking.  The HDD being rebuilt will function normally.  The amber LED 
will blink at 1Hz and the green LED will blink with I/O.  
 
AFFECTED CONFIGURATIONS: 
 
ThinkServer
 
AFFECTED SYSTEMS: 
 
ThinkServer TD340
 
SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:
 
RAID100 (LSI Onboard SATA RAID) configured with Hot-Swappable HDDs
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS
 
N/A
 
LIMITATIONS: 
 
This issue only exists in the RAID100 OPROM configuration User Interface.  
The HDD LEDs will function properly when the server is booted to an 
operating system.
 
SOLUTION:
 
None.
 
WORKAROUND:
 
The lights will show correctly when a server is booted to the operating 
system to do a RAID rebuild in the background.

TITLE:  
 
Startup process stops responding on a Microsoft Windows Server 2008 
R2-based operating system
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
The Startup process may stop responding on a Microsoft Windows Server 2008 
R2-based operating system as explained below.
 
1)  The system is configured with an LSI 9260 and a Fibre Channel adapter 
or with an LSI 9270, LSI 9207, and a Fibre Channel adapter.
2)  Install Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2/SP1 operating system.
3)  Install the storage and Fibre Channel adapter driver.
4)  Reboot and the system may randomly stop responding during the startup 
process.
 
AFFECTED CONFIGURATIONS:

ThinkServer
 
AFFECTED SYSTEMS:
 
The above symptom is associated with, but not limited to, the following 
systems:
 
TD340
 
SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:
 
ThinkServer TD340 with LSI 9260 RAID controller and Fibre Channel adapter
ThinkServer TD340 with LSI 9270, LSI 9207, and Fibre Channel adapter
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS:
 
Windows Server 2008 R2 X64
Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 X64
 
SOLUTION:
 
This issue occurs because the execution of code instructions in the 
Storport.sys driver is not completed in the expected order.  This may 
cause the completed I/O to not be flushed.
Microsoft recommends installing the hotfix from the Microsoft KB article 
which is located at the following URL:

SYMPTOM:  
 
A ThinkServer RD430 system may hang when installing RedHat 6.3 32-bit 
operating system when using certain NIC adapters as explained below:
 
1.  Insert the three NIC cards: X520-SR2, X520-DA2, X540-T2.
2.  Install RedHat 6.3 32-bit operating system.
3.  Power on and boot into the operating system.  The system will hang 
after clicking the “next” button at the password input screen.
 
NOTE:  EasyStartup will also be affected by this issue.
 
AFFECTED CONFIGURATIONS:
 
ThinkServer
 
AFFECTED SYSTEMS: 
 
RD430
 
SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:
 
Intel Ethernet Server Adapter X520-SR2
Intel Ethernet Server Adapter X520-DA2
Intel Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X540-T2
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS: 
 
Red Hat 6.3 32-bit
 
SOLUTION:
 
When installation starts, type “linux dd blacklist=ixgbe” as a boot option 
to make sure the kernel will not load the inbox “ixgbe” driver.  After the 
installation completes, install the newest “ixgbe” driver to the Intel 10G 
NICs.


After installing the newest “ixgbe” driver, type “insmod ixgbe.ko” to run 
“ixgbe.ko” module by hand.  The NIC card will function normally.

 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
The inbox “ixgbe” driver, version is 3.3.8, has an issue when the system 
has one X540 and two X520 NICs installed.  The driver version 3.12.6, and 
higher, will resolve this issue.
 
If the user is attempting to load EasyStartup with this configuration, 
they will see this issue and need to load the operating system manually.

TITLE:  
 
BSOD error will occur when trying to restart Microsoft Windows Server 2008 
R2-based operating system
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
When restarting Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2-based operating system, 
the system crashes and an error message “STOP: 0x000000E3” will display as 
shown below.
 

 
AFFECTED CONFIGURATIONS:

The above symptom is associated with, but not limited to, the following 
systems:

ThinkServer
 
AFFECTED SYSTEMS:
 
RD340
RD440
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS:
 
Windows Server 2008 R2 X64
Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 X64
 
SOLUTION:
 
This issue occurs because the ERESOURCE structure is applied incorrectly 
when the components that are used by the “Ci.dll” file are not initialized 
yet.  In this case, this issue occurs because the Event Tracing for 
Windows (ETW) event handle is set too early before the initialization 
phase is complete.
To resolve this issue, install the hotfix from the Microsoft KB article at 
the following URL: 
 
      http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2735209/en-us

TITLE:  
 
ThinkServer TD340 not booting to the operating system or locating drives
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
The ThinkServer TD340 system may not complete boot to the operating system 
and/or may not discover drives attached to the onboard controller.
 
This issue is more likely to occur under the following scenarios: 
·         The server is booting for the first time.
·         There have been changes on BIOS setting or drive configuration.
·         There has been a hardware component replacement.
 
This issue is not likely to occur on a routine power cycle.
 
AFFECTED CONFIGURATIONS:
 
ThinkServer
 
AFFECTED SYSTEMS:
 
TD340
 
SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:
 
Onboard drive controller
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS:
 
All Operating Systems
 
LIMITATIONS: 
 
This is not a limitation.  This is an issue between the hardware 
connections and the enablement through the BIOS.
 
SOLUTION:
 
Depending on how the drives are connected to the server main board, the 
BIOS settings need to be adjusted.
 
1.  Verify that the drive cables are properly connected.
2.  Check the BIOS or update the settings below:

       If the drives are connected to the onboard SATA controller (see 
Figure 1):
a.  Configuring a RAID volume:
                     SATA Mode = RAID Mode
                     Onboard SCU Controller = Disabled
b.  Configuring a non-RAID volume (JBOD mode):
                     SATA Mode = ACHI
                     Onboard SCU Controller = Disabled
 
c.       On the onboard SATA controller, there could be up to 4 cables to 
connect to hard drives.  The bottom two connectors shown on the Figure 1 
are for optical media.
 
       If the drives are connected to the onboard SAS controller (see 
Figure 2):
a.  SATA Mode = ACHI

b.  Onboard SCU Controller = Enabled
 
NOTE:  Even when using the SAS onboard controller the two SATA ports for 
optical media will remain active.
 
How to update the BIOS settings:
1.  Power on the system.
2.  Press F1 to enter the BIOS.
3.  Move to the “Advanced” tab.
4.  Highlight the “SAS/SATA Configuration” entry and press Enter.
a.  Highlight “SATA Mode” and choose the appropriate option.
              The options are: “IDE”, “ACHI”, and “RAID Mode”.
b.  Highlight “Onboard SCU Controller” and enable/disable as needed.
5.  Verify the options needed are selected.
6.  Press F10 to save changes and reboot.
 
NOTE:  For additional information on the system hardware, reference the 
ThinkServer TD340 “User Guide and Hardware Maintenance Manual” which is 
available at the Lenovo eSupport site at the following URL:
 
       http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/
 
	
Figure 1	Figure 2
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
The cables to connect to the onboard SAS and SATA controller are different.
 
If connecting to the onboard SATA controller SAS drives are not supported 
and they will not be discovered.
 
If connecting to the onboard SAS controller, SAS and SATA drives are 
supported.

to load iastora.sys, iastors.sys, or iastor.sys files
Hard drive (HDD) not detected during image deployment
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
When installing an image or an OEM operating system CD, the user attempts 
to install the Storage driver.  The system displays an error and cannot 
load the iastora.sys, iastors.sys, or iastor.sys files.
Image deployment fails to recognize hard drive (HDD) when deploying image 
with SCCM, MDT, Ghost, WinPE, and other utilities.
 
This issue exists because the files being used are incorrect for the 
installation.
 
AFFECTED CONFIGURATIONS:
 
ThinkStation
 
AFFECTED SYSTEMS:
 
C30
D30
S30
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS:

SOLUTION:
 
The user should download the Intel RSTe driver that is specific to the 
system from the Lenovo eSupport site at the following URL:
 
http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/
 
The user should only perform the first part of the installation which is 
the extract.  Then, a check box will appear on the Window and ask the user 
to finish and install the extracted driver.  The user should either click 
Cancel or uncheck the driver and click Finish as shown in the pictures 
below.

SOLUTION:
 
This issue is fixed by running a firmware and boot code update.
 
Update the HBA firmware and boot code to versions 2.01a11 and 5.12a14, or 
later.  Lenovo provides two images to resolve the issue.  One is the boot 
code image and the other is the firmware image.  

Follow the steps below to update the firmware and boot code:
1.  Make a USB DOS bootable stick.
2.  Download the firmware flash kit from the Lenovo eSupport website. 
3.  Copy the update kit and two images into the USB stick directory. 
(e.g., /Lenovo/)
4.  Configure the ThinkServer with LPe1250 or Lpe12002 cards.
5.  Plug in and boot into the USB stick.
6.  Run the following commands which use the LPe1250 running the update of 
2.01a11 and 512a14 as an example.  The firmware versions will change 
depending on the release.
a)  Find the adapter number:
##doslpcfg listhba

 
b)  Update the boot code:
#doslpcfg download n=<adapter number> i=<absolute path>/OP512a14.prg

c)  Update the firmware:
#doslpcfg download n=<adapter number> i=<absolute path>/of201a11.all

7.  Follow the below command to update the LPe12002 boot code and firmware.
a.  Check the adapter number:
#doslpcfg listhba  
Please record the <adapter number>           
b.  Update the boot code:
#doslpcfg download n=<adapter number> i=<absolute path>/UU512a14.prg
c.  Update the firmware:
#doslpcfg download n=<adapter number> i=<absolute path>/ud201a11.all

TITLE:  
 
Failed hard drive history on LSI hardware RAID Controller
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
Hard drives that have previously failed on a LSI hardware RAID Controller 
will no longer be usable on that Controller.
 
AFFECTED CONFIGURATIONS:
 
ThinkStation
ThinkServer
 
AFFECTED SYSTEMS:
 
ThinkServer systems with LSI 9240-8i RAID Controller (ThinkServer RAID 
500) or LSI 9260-8i RAID Controller (ThinkServer RAID 700)
 
SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:
 
LSI 9240-8i RAID Controller (ThinkServer RAID 500) 
LSI 9260-8i RAID Controller (ThinkServer RAID 700)
LSI 9270-8i RAID Controller (ThinkServer RAID 710)
LSI 9280-8e RAID Controller 
LSI 9286CV-8e RAID Controller
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS:
 
All Operating Systems
 
LIMITATIONS: 
 
This is not a limitation.  This is a RAID Controller feature description.
 
SOLUTION:
 
Use MegaCLI on the RAID Controller BIOS configuration utility to change 
the default setting.
 
Lenovo recommends to maintain the failed hard drive history default 
setting on all production systems.  Disabling it may lead to the use of 
defective hard drives and ultimately result in data being lost or 
unavailable or failed RAID volumes.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
LSI 9240-8i RAID Controller (ThinkServer RAID 500) and LSI 9260-8i RAID 
Controller (ThinkServer RAID 700) have the ability to maintain information 
about hard drives that have been previously used and have failed.
 
All LSI 9240-8i RAID Controllers have the ability to maintain information 
about hard drives that have been previously used and have failed.
 
The RAID Controller will block these drives from being used again, even if 
the drives appear to recover from a suboptimal state.
 
When the RAID Controller marks a drive as failed, it is because there is 
something wrong.  In order to protect the data on the system, the drive 
will not be used again to avoid giving a false sense of security.
 
It should be noted that this will also affect drives that are manually 
removed from the system (while in good condition) and added again (i.e. 
during testing).
 
For testing and validation purposes, this feature can be disabled from the 
Controller BIOS configuration utility or using MegaCLI.  
 
MegaCLI:
 
-    To check the failed hard drive history settings:
              MegaCLI -AdpGetProp –MaintainPdFailHistoryEnbl a0
 
-    To disable failed hard drive history:
              MegaCLI –AdpSetProp –MaintainPdFailHistoryEnbl 0 a0
 
-    To enable failed hard drive history:
              MegaCLI –AdpSetProp –MaintainPdFailHistoryEnbl 1 a0
 
Controller BIOS configuration utility:
 
-    Boot the server. 
-    Press Ctrl-H to enter the BIOS configuration utility.
-    Select the appropriate Controller.
-    Press “Start” button.
-    Select “Controller Properties”.
-    Search for “Maintain PD Fail History” (may need to press “Next” to 
move to the next page of Controller properties).
-    Select “Enabled” or “Disabled” as needed.
-    Click “Submit”.
 

 
Lenovo recommends to maintain the failed hard drive history default 
setting on all production systems. Disabling it may lead to the use of 
defective hard drives and ultimately result in data being lost or 
unavailable or failed RAID volumes.

SOLUTION:
 
Changing (on the server) the TFTP Window and Block Size of the transfer 
can improve the transfer rate of the file.  Microsoft has provided 
instructions to perform this task at the following URL:
       
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731245(WS.10).aspx#BKMK_41
 
NOTES:
1.  Increasing window size dictates how many blocks of data go into the 
window before sending it.  Block size determines how large the Blocks of 
data are that go into the window.
2.  The optimum Window and Block sizes depend on your physical network 
layout.
EXAMPLE COMMANDS:

C:\RemoteInstall\Tmp>bcdedit /store C:\RemoteInstall\boot\x64\default.bcd 
/set {68d9e51c-a129-4ee1-9725-2ab00a957daf} ramdisktftpwindowsize 8
The operation completed successfully.

	Random Reboots on 20 series for Workstations
	
	
	
	

Carla, Paul, Karen, and Elmira
                Will you please redistribute the following TIP on 
Disabling C-States for random reboots to your teams, associated teams, and 
call takers for Workstations? 
http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/downloads/detail.page?DocID=HT075587 
 
I just had a case, SF 00967927, where a system board and power supply were 
replaced to fix a known issue that is only resolved by disabling C-States 
per the TIP above.  
Thanks. Have a blessed day!

TITLE:  
 
RAID100 (Intel RSTe) not utilizing 100 percent hard disk drive’s capacity 
when creating RAID volume
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
The RAID100 (Intel RSTe) is not utilizing 100 percent hard disk drive’s 
capacity when creating RAID volume.
 
This is working as design for Intel RSTe.  When a RAID volume is created, 
Intel RSTe will analyze the physical disks and will automatically adjust 
(round down) the capacity of the disk(s) to 95 percent of the smallest 
physical disk.  This allows for the variances in the physical disk 
capacities from different vendors.
 
This feature is called “Disk Coercion” which is a common feature for most 
RAID solutions.

ThinkServer
 
AFFECTED SYSTEMS:

SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:
 
Intel RSTe Onboard SATA RAID (ATA set to RAID mode in BIOS setup)
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS:
 
All Operating Systems
 
LIMITATIONS: 
 
This is not a limitation.  The Intel RSTe configuration user interface 
still allows users to enter the volume size that could 100 percent utilize 
the physical disk capacity.
 
SOLUTION:
 
None.
 
WORKAROUND: 
 
If user wants to utilize 100 percent physical disk capacity, the user 
needs to calculate the volume size and enter the number manually.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
This behavior is working as designed.

SYMPTOM:  
 
Intel Rapid Storage Technology enterprise (RSTe) RAID contains a feature 
to allow users to add more physical disks to RAID0 and RAID5 volumes to 
expand the volume size.
 
The “Add disk” option is not available when the volume size is going to 
exceed 2TB after this operation.

after this operation.
 
SOLUTION:
 
None.
 
WORKAROUND: 
 
The user should create a new RSTe RAID volume of any size (no limitation) 
instead of adding a physical disk to the existing volume.

system may be very slow in response to actions such as a moving mouse.  If 
the DRAM is increased to 8GB, or larger, or a change to the CPU of other 
SKUs, this issue will not occur.

(Standard/Enterprise/Foundations)
 
SOLUTION:
 
None.
 
WORKAROUND: 
 
The user should increase DRAMs to at least 8GB.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
This is a known behavior because of the special design for any VHD SKU 
(E3-1285) and Microsoft Windows 2008 R2.  Because the VHD and KVM usage 
model requires more video memory in the Server operating system, Intel 
onboard graphic driver specially pre-allocates 1.5GB video memory.  
Therefore, to have VHD SKUs in WS2K8 R2, the user must install at least 
8GB in order to ensure a high quality user experience.

TITLE:  
 
RAID100 (Intel RSTe) volume may change to “Initialize” or “Verify” status 
if system is not shut down completely
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
If a system loses power before completely shutting down, the Intel Rapid 
Storage Technology enterprise (RSTe) RAID volume may change to the 
“Initialize” or “Verify” status when the system is powered on again.
 
This is working as designed for Intel RSTe.  If the server lost power when 
there is I/O to hard disk drives, the RAID metadata could be inconsistent 
among all hard disk drives.  In that case, the Intel RSTe RAID volume will 
change to the “Initialize” or “Verify” status when the system is powered 
on again.
 
For RAID1, RAID5, and RAID10 volumes:
 
If volume has not initialized yet, it will change to the “Initialize” 
status to provide full data protection ability.  This process cannot be 
aborted.
 
For RAID0, initialized RAID1, initialized RAID5, and initialized RAID10 
volumes:
 
It will change to the “Verify” status to verify data integrity.  This 
process can be aborted if the user believes the data is safe or would take 
the risk of losing data.
 
This is similar to the operating system requesting a file system check on 
an incomplete shutdown, except this is in RAID layer.  The “Initialize” 
and “Verify” status will have no risk of losing user data on disk.
 
AFFECTED CONFIGURATIONS:
 
ThinkServer
 
AFFECTED SYSTEMS:
 
TS140
TS440
RS140
 
SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:
 
Intel RSTe Onboard SATA RAID (ATA set to RAID mode in BIOS setup)
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS:
 
All Operating Systems
 
LIMITATIONS: 
 
The Intel RSTe volume in the “Initialize” or “Verify” status will do no 
harm to user data, but the system performance could be slightly impacted 
as the process would take some background disk I/O resource.  Also, the 
process could last for several days on a Terabyte level RAID volume.
 
SOLUTION:
 
None.
 
WORKAROUND:
 
In order to protect data, it is always recommended to perform a clean 
system shutdown.  If the RSTe RAID volume changed to the “Verify” status 
after an incomplete shutdown, then this process can be aborted if the user 
believes the data is safe or would take the risk of losing data.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
This behavior is working as designed.

TITLE:
 
RAID100 (Intel RSTe) RAID level migration process may take several days to 
complete
 
SYMPTOM:
 
When performing an Intel Rapid Storage Technology enterprise (RSTe) RAID 
level migration (2 HDD RAID0 migrate to 3 HDD RAID5), the process may be 
slow and take several days to complete.
 
The Intel RSTe software RAID is a low-end solution that needs to utilize 
server CPU and memory resource.  The RAID level migrate operation utilizes 
a significant amount of CPU, memory, and HDD resource.  The Intel RSTe is 
designed to perform this operation in the background process which can 
avoid causing a significant performance impact to the system.
 
AFFECTED CONFIGURATIONS:
 
ThinkServer
 
AFFECTED SYSTEMS:
 
TS140
TS440
RS140
 
SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:
 
Intel RSTe Onboard SATA RAID (ATA set to RAID mode in the BIOS setup)
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS:

Microsoft Windows XP 
Microsoft Windows PE
Microsoft Windows Server 
 
LIMITATIONS: 
 
The RSTe RAID level migrate operation will have no limitation to the user 
software, except for a slight system performance drop due to this 
background task.
 
SOLUTION:
 
None.
 
WORKAROUND: 
 
During the RSTe RAID level migration, the user can always check the 
process percentage from the Intel RSTe utility in Windows to estimate when 
the migration will complete.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
This behavior is working as designed.

MegaRAID Utility may display a “Failed to Import Foreign Configuration” 
error
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
The MegaRAID Utility may display a “Failed to Import Foreign 
Configuration” error.  There are two ways the error may occur:
 
1.  In a server system, if the HDDs are offline and the system is power 
cycled, the RAID configuration will be removed.  If the user selects for 
the HDDs to come back online, they can import the original RAID 
configuration.  If the user chooses to import an individual RAID 
configuration (for example, “Configuration 1” or “Configuration 2”), the 
import will fail.
 
2.  If a user changes the RAID card in the system by removing the old card 
and inserting a new one, they may choose to import the original array.  
However, if the new card does not support features that the original 
configuration used, the import will fail, such as importing a volume that 
has caching enabled on a controller that does not support caching.

also must make sure if they insert a new RAID card that it supports all 
the features used in the old card.

Roaming User Profiles may not be synchronized on server if system is

SYMPTOM:  
 
The Roaming User Profiles may not be synchronized on the server if the 
system is installed with Hotkey Features Integration.

The Roaming User Profile feature has been enabled on the server for the 
Domain account.  The Domain account can be used to log onto a Client 
system installed with the Hotkey Features Integration program.  After 
making some changes to the personal profiles, log off and re-log onto a 
second Client system in the same domain.  The changes are not applied on 
the Client system.
 
Since the Roaming User Profile is enabled for your Domain account, the 
user should get the same profiles when logging onto different systems with 
the Domain account.

AFFECTED SYSTEMS: 
All
 
SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:

OPERATING SYSTEMS:

SOLUTION:
 
This issue might be caused by Hotkey Features Integration installed on the 
Client system.  Updating Hotkey Features Integration to the latest version 
may resolve the issue. 
 
To determine which type of Hotkey Features Integration supports the 
computer model of the Client system, check the README file of Hotkey 
Features Integration.  The latest version of Hotkey Features Integration 
and the README file are available on the Lenovo Support Web site at the

RAID controller.  In the event of a power loss, cached data may be lost.
 
AFFECTED CONFIGURATIONS: 
 
ThinkServer
 
AFFECTED SYSTEMS:
 
TS440
TD340
RD340
RD440
RD540
RD640
 
SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:
 
LSI 9270(RAID 710)/9286 with SuperCap version 49571-13 Revision A and 
CacheCade/CacheVault feature enabled.
 

 
NOTE:  The SuperCap version 49571-03 Revision A is not exposed to this 
issue.
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS: 
 
N/A
 
SOLUTION:
 
New firmware will be released which will resolve this issue.  Firmware is 
currently under development.  Monitor this Tip for updates and a link to 
the revised firmware when it is available.  Replacing the SuperCap or RAID 
card will not resolve this issue.
 
NOTE:  Do not replace any hardware for this issue. 
 
WORKAROUND:
 
There are two workarounds for this issue as shown below.
 
OPTION 1:
 
Perform a cold boot on the system:
  
-Perform a clean shutdown/power off of the system.
-Remove AC Power and wait for all power to drain from the system (up to 30 
seconds).
-Re-apply power to the system.
-Power on the system.
 
OPTION 2:
 
Disable write back cache on the controller.  Choose one of the following 
methods to perform this action:
 
a)  Within MegaRAID Storage Manager (MSM) perform the following actions:
 
- Select the “Logical” tab.
- Right Click the Virtual Drive Group and select “Set Virtual Drive 
Properties”.
- Beside “Write Policy”, select the drop down box and click “Write 
Through”.
 

 
- Click OK.
- Click the “Confirm” check box and select “Yes” on the warning message to 
confirm the changes.
- Reboot the system for changes to take effect.
 
b)  Via the WebBIOS:
 
- Reboot the system and press Ctrl+H at the RAID POST screen to enter the 
LSI WebBIOS Utility.
- Click Start.
- Select Virtual Drive from the list on the right side of the screen.
- Change the “Default Write” from “Write Back with BBU” to “Write 
Through”. 
 

 
- Click the “Change” button.
- Exit the LSI WebBIOS and reboot the system.
 
c)  Via MegaCLI command line, issue one of the following commands:
 
- MegaCli -LDSetProp  WT -Lx|-L0,1,2|-L all -aN|-a0,1,2|-aALL
- MegaCli -LDSetProp  WT –Lall –aALL
 
NOTE:  Some arguments may vary depending upon the user’s RAID setup.  See 
the MegaCLI User’s Guide for detailed argument instructions at the 
following URL:  
 
http://download.lenovo.com/ibmdl/pub/pc/pccbbs/thinkservers/megaraid_swug_e
n.pdf
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
After a warm reboot of the user’s system, the user may not receive a 
message/alert within the RAID controller logs.  After 28 days, or if a 
relearn is initiated, the SuperCap may not be able to complete the relearn 
cycle and the user may then see a message stating the relearn cycle has 
timed out.  The cause for this issue is due to an invalid value in the 
Vital Product Data (VPD) within the firmware for the RAID card.
 
To determine the revision level of the SuperCap, the user may enter the 
following megacli/storcli command: 
 
       storcli /c0 show termlog type=contents 
 
This will print the termlog information for the controller and SuperCap.  
Search for ***SCap VPD FIXED*** in the output.  The user should see 
“batPackAssmNo: 49571-13A”.  If the batPackAssmNo displays 4951-03A, the 
SuperCap is not affected by this issue.

TITLE:
 
SuperCap may not be recognized resulting in potential data loss with a LSI 
9270 (RAID 710)/9286 Adapter with SuperCap version 49571-13 Revision A
 
SYMPTOM:
 
User may see one of the following messages in RAID controller logs after 
the default relearn period of 28 days.
 
·         “Controller cache discarded due to memory/battery problems” 
·         “Battery Relearn Timed Out”
 
During the first 28 days after a warm reboot, there is no error from the 
RAID controller.  In the event of a power loss, cached data may be lost.

ThinkServer
 
AFFECTED SYSTEMS:
 
TS440
TD340

SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:
 
LSI 9270(RAID 710)/9286 with SuperCap version 49571-13 Revision A and 
CacheCade/CacheVault feature enabled.
 

 
NOTE:  The SuperCap version 49571-03 Revision A is not exposed to this 
issue.
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS: 
 
N/A
 
SOLUTION:
 
New firmware will be released which will resolve this issue.  Firmware is 
currently under development.  Monitor this Tip for updates and a link to 
the revised firmware when it is available.  Replacing the SuperCap or RAID 
card will not resolve this issue.
 
NOTE:  Do not replace any hardware for this issue.
 
New firmware has been released to resolve this issue which is located at 
the following URL:
 
http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/downloads/detail.page?DocID=DS042144
 
WORKAROUND:
 
There are two workarounds for this issue as shown below.
 
OPTION 1:
 
Perform a cold boot on the system:
  
- Perform a clean shutdown/power off of the system.
- Remove AC Power and wait for all power to drain from the system (up to 
30 seconds).
- Re-apply power to the system.
- Power on the system.
 
OPTION 2:
 
Disable write back cache on the controller.  Choose one of the following 
methods to perform this action:
 
a)  Within MegaRAID Storage Manager (MSM) perform the following actions:
 
- Select the “Logical” tab.
- Right Click the Virtual Drive Group and select “Set Virtual Drive 
Properties”.
- Beside “Write Policy”, select the drop down box and click “Write 
Through”.
 

 
- Click OK.
- Click the “Confirm” check box and select “Yes” on the warning message to 
confirm the changes.
- Reboot the system for changes to take effect.
 
b)  Via the WebBIOS:
 
- Reboot the system and press Ctrl+H at the RAID POST screen to enter the 
LSI WebBIOS Utility.
- Click Start.
- Select Virtual Drive from the list on the right side of the screen.
- Change the “Default Write” from “Write Back with BBU” to “Write 
Through”. 
 

 
- Click the “Change” button.
- Exit the LSI WebBIOS and reboot the system.
 
c)  Via MegaCLI command line, issue one of the following commands:
 
- MegaCli -LDSetProp  WT -Lx|-L0,1,2|-L all -aN|-a0,1,2|-aALL
- MegaCli -LDSetProp  WT –Lall –aALL
 
NOTE:  Some arguments may vary depending upon the user’s RAID setup.  See 
the MegaCLI User’s Guide for detailed argument instructions at the 
following URL:  
 
http://download.lenovo.com/ibmdl/pub/pc/pccbbs/thinkservers/megaraid_swug_e
n.pdf
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
NOTE:  Replacing the SuperCap or RAID card will not resolve this issue.  
Do not replace any hardware for this issue. 
 
After a warm reboot of the user’s system, the user may not receive a 
message/alert within the RAID controller logs.  After 28 days, or if a 
relearn is initiated, the SuperCap may not be able to complete the relearn 
cycle and the user may then see a message stating the relearn cycle has 
timed out.  The cause for this issue is due to an invalid value in the 
Vital Product Data (VPD) within the firmware for the RAID card.
 
To determine the revision level of the SuperCap, the user may enter the 
following megacli/storcli command: 
 
       storcli /c0 show termlog type=contents 
 
This will print the termlog information for the controller and SuperCap.  
Search for ***SCap VPD FIXED*** in the output.  The user should see 
“batPackAssmNo: 49571-13A”.  If the batPackAssmNo displays 4951-03A, the 
SuperCap is not affected by this issue.

Dan,
 
I wanted to make sure you were aware of this issue with LSI 9270 (RAID 
710)/9286 Adapter with SuperCap.  We would like your team to proactively 
apply the below firmware update for all customers who call with the below 
configuration.
There is a link on the support page under Top News on the lower right.
 
SuperCap may not be recognized resulting in potential data loss with a LSI 
9270 (RAID 710)/9286 Adapter (version 49571-13 Rev A)
 
 
http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/detail.page?DocID=HT082804
 
 
SuperCap may not be recognized resulting in potential data loss with a LSI 
9270 (RAID 710)/9286 Adapter with SuperCap version 49571-13 Revision A
Symptom
User may see one of the following messages in RAID controller logs after 
the default relearn period of 28 days.
"Controller cache discarded due to memory/battery problems"
"Battery Relearn Timed Out"
During the first 28 days after a warm reboot, there is no error from the 
RAID controller.  In the event of a power loss, cached data may be lost.
Affected configurations
The above symptom is associated with, but not limited to, the following 
systems:
ThinkServer TS440
ThinkServer TD340
ThinkServer RD340, RD440, RD540, RD640
System is configured with:
·         LSI 9270(RAID 710)/9286 with SuperCap version 49571-13 Revision 
A and CacheCade/CacheVault feature enabled.

·         NOTE:  The SuperCap version 49571-03 Revision A is not exposed 
to this issue.
Applies to:
N/ASolution
New firmware has been released to resolve this issue which is located at 
the following URL:
Firmware for LSI 9270/9286 SAS RAID card for Windows and Linux - 
ThinkServer RD340, RD440, RD540, RD640, TD340, TS440
Workaround
There are two workarounds for this issue as shown below.
OPTION 1:
Perform a cold boot on the system:
Perform a clean shutdown/power off of the system.
Remove AC Power and wait for all power to drain from the system (up to 30 
seconds).
Re-apply power to the system.
Power on the system.
OPTION 2:
Disable write back cache on the controller.  Choose one of the following 
methods to perform this action:
a)  Within MegaRAID Storage Manager (MSM) perform the following actions:
Select the "Logical" tab.
Right Click the Virtual Drive Group and select "Set Virtual Drive 
Properties".
Beside "Write Policy", select the drop down box and click "Write Through".


Click OK.
Click the "Confirm" check box and select "Yes" on the warning message to 
confirm the changes.
Reboot the system for changes to take effect.
b) Via the WebBIOS:
Reboot the system and press Ctrl+H at the RAID POST screen to enter the 
LSI WebBIOS Utility.
Click Start.
Select Virtual Drive from the list on the right side of the screen
Change the "Default Write" from "Write Back with BBU" to "Write Through".


Click the "Change" button.
Exit the LSI WebBIOS and reboot the system
c) Via MegaCLI command line, issue one of the following commands:
MegaCLI -LDSetProp WT -Lx|-L0,1,2|-L all -aN|-a0,1,2|-aALL
MegaCli -LDSetProp  WT –Lall –aALL

NOTE:  Some arguments may vary depending upon the user’s RAID setup.  See 
the MegaCLI User’s Guide for detailed argument instructions at the 
following URL:  

http://download.lenovo.com/ibmdl/pub/pc/pccbbs/thinkservers/megaraid_swug_e
n.pdf
 
Additional Information:
NOTE:  Replacing the SuperCap or RAID card will not resolve this issue.  
Do not replace any hardware for this issue. 
After a warm reboot of the user’s system, the user may not receive a 
message/alert within the RAID controller logs.  After 28 days, or if a 
relearn is initiated, the SuperCap may not be able to complete the relearn 
cycle and the user may then see a message stating the relearn cycle has 
timed out.  The cause for this issue is due to an invalid value in the 
Vital Product Data (VPD) within the firmware for the RAID card.
 
To determine the revision level of the SuperCap, the user may enter the 
following megacli/storcli command: 
 
       storcli /c0 show termlog type=contents 
 
This will print the termlog information for the controller and SuperCap.  
Search for ***SCap VPD FIXED*** in the output.  The user should see 
“batPackAssmNo: 49571-13A”.  If the batPackAssmNo displays 4951-03A, the 
SuperCap is not affected by this issue.

Battery will only charge to 50-70 percent on RAID700 (LSI9270-8i) and

SYMPTOM:  
 
The Battery Backup Unit (BBU) on the RAID700 (LSI9270-8i) and LSI9280-8i 
RAID controller will charge to only about 50 to 70 percent, after charging 
or the Learn Cycle.  Previously, it used to charge to around 100 percent.

OPERATING SYSTEMS:

LIMITATIONS: 
 
The BBU charge and maintenance algorithm has changed to prolong the life 
of the battery.
 
SOLUTION:
 
None.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
This is a new behavior, not an issue, which will not impact system 
functionality or specifications.
 
Long term testing have concluded that maintaining the BBU charge to around 
75 percent of full capacity may extend the useful life of the battery.
 
The controller is designed for the BBU to hold data in cache for a minimum 
of 24 hours.  The charge needed for this is less than 75 percent.  
Maintaining the battery charge at 75 percent will prolong the life of the 
battery without affected cache retention capabilities.
 
All other controller and BBU functions will not be impacted by this new 
battery behavior.  This new behavior was introduced on a new RAID 
controller firmware package release in early 2014.
 
Do not dispatch any hardware when the battery only charges up to 50—70 
percent after the Learn Cycle or charge process, even if used to charge to 
100 percent previously with older firmware.

Please forward to team.

The HMM on the Lenovo D30 and the S30 is almost worthless at describing 
the SATA ports and what they are intended for or what color they are so I 
pieced it together and came up with this.

For the S30:


And for the D30:

TITLE:
 
RAID displays “configuration gone” warning message during POST with no 
Virtual Disk (VD) on LSI 9270CV-8i or 9286CV-8e
 
SYMPTOM:
 
On a ThinkServer configured with LSI 9270CV-8i or 9286CV-8e RAID card, 
when the RAID card has no configuration, the user may see one of the 
following “configuration gone” warning messages during the server POST 
after pressing F10 (Save & Exit) in the F1 Server BIOS setup.
 

 

 
This issue will occur only when all the following conditions are present:
·         LSI 9270/9286 RAID card has no configuration (such as no RAID 
volume, no HSP, no JBOD, etc.).
·         RAID card “Boot Error Handling” property is set to “Stop on 
errors” (default for LSI 9270/9286).
·         User pressed F10 (Save & Exit) in the Server BIOS setup utility 
and server reboot.
 
This warning message is a false alarm that can be safely ignored as the 
RAID card currently has null configuration.  However, this is a false 
alarm only when all the above conditions are present.
 
If the user sees this warning message without meeting any of the above 
conditions, it means the “configuration gone” event is occurring.  In that 
case, the proper action needs to occur to prevent potential data lose.
 
AFFECTED BRANDS:
 
ThinkServer
 
AFFECTED SYSTEMS:
 
ThinkServer TD340
ThinkServer RD340
ThinkServer RD440
ThinkServer RD540
ThinkServer RD640
 
SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:
 
LSI RAID card including 9270CV-8i / 9286CV-8e
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS:
 
N/A
 
SOLUTION:
 
This issue will be resolved with the below version of BIOS which will be 
released in the Fourth Quarter 2014.
 
RD340/440：79A
RD540/640: 79A
TD340: 6DA
 
WORKAROUND:
 
If this issue occurs and the user wishes to keep the LSI 9270/9286 in null 
configuration for a while, then any of the following clear configuration 
actions will clear this false alarm:
 
·         Enter LSI RAID card WebBIOS, click on “Configuration Wizard”, 
then select “Clear Configuration” radio box and click on “Next” button, 
and click on “Yes” to confirm the action.
·         In any operating system that supports storcli command line 
utility, run the “storcli /cN/vall del” command to clear the 
configuration.  Replace the “N” with actual RAID card index (N=0, 1, 2 
...).
·         In any operating system that supports MegaRAID Storage Manager 
(MSM) graphics utility, launch MSM, right click on the RAID card selected 
in "Physical" or "Logical" view, and then click "Clear Configuration" on 
the pop-up menu, and confirm the action.
 
NOTE:  After any of the above clear configuration actions, this false 
alarm will show up again if the user pressed F10 (Save & Exit) in the 
Server BIOS setup with null configuration on RAID card.
 
Alternatively, user can change RAID card “Boot Error Handling” property to 
any other value than default “Stop on errors”, and change it back when 
configuration is created. This can be done by any of the following action.
·         Enter LSI RAID card WebBIOS, click on “Controller Properties”, 
click on “Next” button and locate “Boot Error Handling” property, select 
any other value in the drop-down menu rather than default “Stop on 
errors”, and click on “Submit” button.
·         In any operating system that support storcli command line 
utility, run “storcli /cN set stoponerror=off” command, need to replace 
“N” with actual RAID card index (N=0, 1, 2 ...).
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
This issue is caused by improper handling of the RAID card null 
configuration situation when the user presses F10 (Save & Exit) in the 
Server BIOS setup utility.
 
The user should confirm this issue is occurring before taking any action.  
Clearing the RAID configuration is one dangerous operation that could 
result in data loss.
 
This warning message can be safely ignored.  However once this occurs, the 
false alarm message will keep showing up every time the server boots up if 
no action is taken.
 
After the RAID volume VD is created, this false alarm will go away.  This 
should cover most occurrences, as the RAID volume needs to be created in 
order to utilize the hard drive attached to the LSI RAID cards.

Explanation of Power Supply Status Light Codes
 
SYMPTOM:
 
A ThinkServer system with two power supplies installed may display 
different or unexpected status LED patterns.
 
AFFECTED BRAND:
 
ThinkServer
 
AFFECTED SYSTEMS:
 
All PSU redundant-enabled systems
 
SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:
 
Two PSUs
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS:
 
All Operating Systems
 
SOLUTION:
 
In the Hardware Maintenance Manual, the product overview describes the 
power supply status LEDs as follows:
 
On each hot-swap redundant power supply, there is a status LED near the 
power cord connector.  When the LED is lit in green, it indicates that the 
hot-swap redundant power supply is working correctly.  When the LED is lit 
in amber, it indicates that the hot-swap redundant power supply is likely 
to fail or has failed.
 
The following is new additional information that is being added to the HMM:
 
The behavior of redundant-enabled power supplies under medium or heavy 
load is a load sharing configuration in which both power supplies will be 
active.  While under light load, one power supply in a redundant-enabled 
configuration may enter a power-saving cold redundancy mode and its LED 
will change from solid green to blinking green.  This does not affect the 
power supply’s ability to support the system in the event that the other 
power supply fails.

SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:
 
ThinkServer TS140/TS440 with onboard VGA
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS:
 
SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Service Pack 3
 
LIMITATIONS: 
 
The onboard VGA driver of the native kernel (3.0.76-0.11) of SLES11 SP3 
has the issue when running 2D/3D test.  The issue has been resolved in the 
newer kernel.  Updating the kernel is necessary to resolve this issue.
 
SOLUTION:
 
Update the kernel of SLES11 SP3 from the native kernel (3.0.76-0.11) to 
the newer kernel (3.0.101-0.29):
 
1)  Download kernel (3.0.101-0.29) RPM files from the following URL:
http://download.novell.com/patch/finder/
 
NOTE:  This this kernel version was released on May 15, 2014
2)  The following are two alternatives to update the kernel:
a.  Command Line: Use the RPM Utility to update the downloaded kernel RPM 
files.
b.  GUI: 
                        i.   Launch “Software Management” or “Install/
Remove software” application.
                       ii.   Click the item from the top menu: 
“Configuration-->Repositories”. Add a “Local Directory” that the Kernel 
patch files located on the folder you downloaded and save.
                     iii.   Search "kernel" to list kernel related 
packages.  The operating system native kernel will be highlighted with new 
Kernel version.
                       iv.   Right click the highlighted item then select 
“Update”.
                        v.   Click “Accept” to start package update.
3)  After updating the kernel, reboot the system to load the newer kernel 
version.

SYMPTOM:  
 
LPe16004B was linked with External Storage (EMC VNX5300).  In UEFI only 
mode, the error message “Fabric Login Failed” is displayed after 
navigating the “Scan for Fibre devices” command in the UEFI BIOS WebUI.  
When sensing the adapter status by navigating “Displayer Adapter Info”, it 
displayed that the link speed is 4Gb/s.

OPERATING SYSTEMS: 
 
N/A
 
SOLUTION:
 
This is working as designed.  Normally, the HBA is connected with 
FiberChannel switch and not connected with the storage directly.  The HBA 
default setting is for FCSW topologic.  If the user needs to connect with 
the storage directly, then the user needs to change the configuration.
 
WORKAROUND:
 
Entry the BIOS in UEFI mode and select the Boot Manager page, set the 
“Force Link Speed” item to “8 Gb/s Link Speed”, and set “Topology 
Selection” item to “FCAL” as shown below.  Then, set BFS configuration and 
save. 

 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
The root cause is the HBA connection with storage directly.  It must use 
FCAL topology.  If not, the speed negotiation will not be stable and then 
may cause the link to fail.

SLES 11.3 may log “iTCO_wdt” failure messages during boot
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
When booting into SLES11 SP3, “iTCO_wdt” failure messages may be observed 
in the system logs.

SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:

OPERATING SYSTEMS: 
 
SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Service Pack 3 (SLES 11.3)
 
LIMITATIONS: 
 
Another watchdog device (MEI watchdog in this case) is already loaded to 
use the /dev/watchdog file.  Therefore, the Intel TCO (Total Cost of 
Ownership) watchdog cannot register the /dev/watchdog file because it is 
occupied by another watchdog device.  This is the kernel limitation in 
SLES11 SP3.
 
The “iTCO_wdt” driver has been reworked to prevent the conflict starting 
from kernel v3.6. 
 
SOLUTION:
 
In order to avoid the failure message, add “blacklist iTCO_wdt” to 
/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-watchdog and then reboot the system.
 
NOTE:  This does not indicate any fault in the system.  The hardware is 
present and SLES11 SP3 does not use the Intel TCO watchdog in this 
scenario.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
This message can be ignored.  Do not dispatch any hardware.

System may continually reboot after downgrading BIOS to lower levels in 
Microsoft Windows operating systems
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
If downgrading a ThinkServer TS140 or TS440 BIOS below 82A or RS140 BIOS 
below 76C using the flash.bat batch file included on the web-released BIOS 
update utility for Windows (BIOSWIN32 or BIOSWIN64), the system will enter 
a continuous reboot loop and it will not boot to the operating system.

TS140
TS440
RS140
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS:
 
Microsoft Windows 8
Microsoft Windows 8.1
Microsoft Windows 2012
Microsoft Windows 2012 R2
 
LIMITATIONS: 
 
The old BIOS BIOSWIN32 and BIOSWIN64 update packages do not properly clear 
the NVRAM which causes this issue.
 
SOLUTION:
 
It is not recommended to downgrade the BIOS.  If there is a need to 
downgrade the BIOS, the downgrade can be executed from the DOS environment 
without issues.
 
Follow the instructions below to downgrade the BIOS from Windows:
1.  Copy the IMAGEFB.ROM file from the old BIOS package into the new BIOS 
update package (overwriting the existing IMAGEFB.ROM file).
2.  Follow new BIOS package upgrade instructions.
 
WORKAROUND:
 
When the issue occurs, it is necessary to execute boot-block recovery 
process, follow these steps:
 
1.  Remove all media from the drives and turn off all attached devices and 
the server. 
2.  Disconnect power. 
3.  Remove the server cover.
4.  Locate the Clear CMOS/Recovery jumper on the system board.  Review the 
“User Guide and Hardware Maintenance Manual” on 
http://support.lenovo.com/us/en.
5.  Remove the Clear CMOS/Recovery jumper.
6.  Move the jumper from the standard position (pin 1 and pin 2) to the 
maintenance position (pin 2 and pin 3).
7.  Reconnect any cables that were disconnected.
8.  Reinstall the server cover and reconnect the power cords.
9.  Turn on the server and then insert the USB key that contains the same 
level BIOS image IMAGEFB.ROM at the root path to the USB port.  The 
recovery session begins.  The recovery session will take two to three 
minutes.  During this time, there will be a series of beeps.
10. After the recovery session is completed, the series of beeps will end, 
and the system will automatically turn off. 
11. Repeat step 1 through step 5.
12. Move the Clear CMOS/Recovery jumper back to the standard position (pin 
1 and pin 2).
13. Reconnect any cables that were disconnected and reinstall the PCI card 
if removed.
14. Reinstall the server cover and reconnect any cables that were 
disconnected.
15. Turn on the server to restart the operating system.
 
NOTE:  After Boot-block recovery and turning on the server, there will be 
a POST Error “Error 0162: Setup data integrity check failure” and all BIOS 
settings will be lost.  The user should follow the message on the bottom 
of the screen to press the hotkey “F1” to enter BIOS SETUP to reconfigure 
the BIOS setting.

TITLE:  
 
HDD/SSD Drive Speed displays as “UNKNOWN” in LSI MSM utility
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
On ThinkServer systems configured with SAS 3.0 (12Gbps) HDD/SSD and some 
LSI RAID cards (9240-8i, 9260-8i or 9280-8e), the Drive Speed will display 
as “UNKNOWN” in the LSI MegaRAID Storage Manager (MSM) utility.

LSI MSM utility
 
SOLUTION:
 
Lenovo will release new 9240/9260/9280 firmware to resolve this issue.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
This is a cosmetic issue with no functional impact.
 
SAS 3.0 industry standards were not defined when LSI developed 
9240/9260/9280 RAID card firmware.  The RAID card firmware is not able to 
interpret SAS 3.0 Drive Speed bits and displays as "UNKNOWN“.
 
LSI RAID cards only support up to SAS 2.0 (6Gbps).  The SAS 3.0 drives 
will negotiate at 6Gbps, thus showing “Negotiated Link Speed” as 6Gbps in 
MSM utility.

SOLUTION:
 
None.
 
WORKAROUND:
 
1.  “Storage OpROM Policy” default value is “UEFI First” or “Legacy 
Only” (depending on the platform).  The user can configure the cards 
through Legacy methods such as WebBIOS in cards.
 
2.  Users can change “Storage OpROM Policy” as “UEFI Only” to install pure 
UEFI operating systems and card functions work well.

System may display “Error 1962” error message during POST with LSI 9240 
RAID card
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
With the LSI 9240 RAID card, the system may not be able to boot to 
operating system when:
1.  Installing a UEFI operating system on one Virtual Disk (VD).
2.  Initializing all the other VDs using GPT partitioning (from UEFI 
environment) and setting “CSM” to “Enabled”.

The “Error 1962: No operating system found. Boot sequence will 
automatically repeat.” message may display during POST.

SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:
 
LSI 9240-8i RAID card
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS:
 
UEFI Operating Systems
 
LIMITATIONS: 
 
There is a limitation if there is more than one VD created with the 
LSI9240 RAID card, when VDs not hosting the operating system are 
initialized as GPT partitions and CSM is set as “Enabled”.  The BIOS 
creates an incorrect BBS entry for the LSI 9240 VDs so that the system 
POST does not detect the right VD that the operating system is installed 
on and it causes the boot failure.
 
SOLUTION:
 
A new BIOS version is currently under development.
 
WORKAROUND:
 
1.  For Windows 2008 R2 and Windows 7 64-bit, customers can install the 
operating system in Legacy mode or format the VDs that do not contain 
operating system boot managers to MBR partitions instead of GPT partitions.
 
2.  For Microsoft Windows 8/8.1/2012/2012 R2 and other PURE UEFI operating 
systems, customers can set the CSM to “Disabled” in SETUP to avoid this 
issue.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
Steps to duplicate this issue:
1.  Power on the system and press “Ctrl” + “H” to enter LSI 9240 WebBIOS 
user interface and create more than one VDs.
2.  Press F1 to enter BIOS SETUP to make sure to set “CSM” is “Enabled” 
and then install UEFI operating system on the first VD.
3.  Enter UEFI environment and format the other VDs as GPT (GUID Partition 
Table).
4.  Reboot the system, system might not be able to boot to the operating 
system installed on the VD, and a POST error might be shown: Error 1962: 
No operating system found. Boot sequence will automatically repeat.

TITLE:  
 
Server cannot boot into an operating system installed onto an iSCSI target 
using the QLE8242 adapter in UEFI mode when setting PXE to Legacy mode
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
If an operating system is installed in uEFI mode on a remote target, the 
server will be unable to boot if the PXE boot mode is set to “Legacy” 
mode.

1.  Change the boot mode to uEFI and reboot.
2.  Press F12 when the system is booting and then choose to boot to the 
correct LUN or change the boot order in the system BIOS.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
The root cause is that the ThinkServer regards the QLE8242 as a network 
device.  The uEFI and Legacy properties of the QLE8242 are controlled by 
the PXE network mode.  For this case, set the “PXE network” to “uEFI”.

ThinkServer RS140/TS140/TS440 with onboard VGA
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS: 
 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 x86/x86_64
 
LIMITATIONS: 
 
There is a limitation with the resolution compatibility between the 
operating system and the monitor.
 
The resolution configuration does not meet the aspect ratio of the 
monitor.  For example:
The aspect ratio of Lenovo Monitor LT1953wF is 16:10:

o    The issue does not occur when the resolution is 1440x900.
o    The issue happens when the resolution settings are 1280x1024, 
1024x768, 800x600, etc.
 
SOLUTION:
 
This issue is corrected on RHEL 6.5.  Refer to the “WORKAROUND” section 
for RHEL6.4.
 
WORKAROUND:
 
There are two alternatives for this issue.
 
1)  Always configure the resolution to meet the aspect ratio on the 
monitor. 
Here is an example for the aspect ratio 16:10.
       # xandr –s 1440x900
 
2)  When observing the corrupted screen, enter the Text mode and re-enter 
the GUI mode by pressing CTRL+Alt+F2 and CTRL+ALT+F1.

The process to replace the PSU is as follows: 
1. Unplug the power cord of the PSU.
2. Remove the PSU from the system.
3. Plug the PSU back in.
4. Plug the power cord of the PSU back in.
The front panel DIT and PSU LED may incorrectly turn on after the fourth 
step.
 
If this issue occurs, unplug the power cord and plug it back in.  The 
lights will turn off.  The PSU will be fully operational if this issue 
occurs.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
An “ipmitool” command can be run to verify this issue (replace BMC_IP with 
actual BMC IP and –U [username] and –P [password] values if necessary):
ipmitool -I lanplus -H BMC_IP -U lenovo -P len0vO -b 0 -t 0x2c raw 0x2e

Check the existing motherboard and the new motherboard.  If the FRU is not 
the same, then the ME driver and the VGA driver needs to be updated to the 
latest version.
 
For user utilizing Microsoft Windows operating system, then update the ME 
driver version to 9.5.14.1724 or later version and update the VGA driver 
version to 10.18.10.3412 or later version.
 
ME driver package: DD_INTEL_ME_9.5.14.1724_Win_x86x64
VGA driver package: DD_INTEL_VGA_10.18.10.3412_WinServer_x64
 
Use 00FC658 to replace 03T8874 for TS440. 
Use 00FC657 to replace 03T8873 for TS140. 
Use 00FC659 to replace 03T8612 for TS140. 
 
The latest driver can be found on below Lenovo support website:

OPERATING SYSTEMS:

LIMITATIONS: 
 
The kernel of RHEL6.5 and SLES11 SP3 introduced a new Intel C-State driver 
to deal with C-States for different types of processors.  This driver 
invokes the CPUID (EAX=05h) to get the supported C-States on the processor 
regardless of _CST objects of ACPI table.  This means C-State information 
is not retrieved from the ACPI table (BIOS setup).

System will Auto Restart if freeipmi-bmc-watchdog has been installed
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
Install RHEL 6.5 with package freeipmi-bmc-watchdog.  Boot into the 
operating system and then the system will Auto Restart periodically.  The 
/var/log/messages log file will display the following message if the issue 
occurs:
 
/usr/sbin/bmc-watchdog[XXXX]: fiid_obj_get: 'present_countdown_value': 
data not available
 
NOTE:  In the BMC log, there will be records saying “watchdog hard reset”.

TD350, RD550, RD650
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS:
 
RedHat Enterprise Linux Server 6.5
 
LIMITATIONS: 
 
According to the RedHat errata article below, this is a known issue which 
can be fixed by updating freepmi packages. 
 
http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2013-1795.html
 
When the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) service was not 
configured and kernel modules were not loaded and the bmc-watchdog timer 
was started, the freeipmi bmc-watchdog could cause an unexpected system 
reboot on certain hardware. 
 
The new update adds the module alias configuration file for use with the 
module-init-tools package.  This configuration provides an early kernel 
module probing rule for systems where the IPMI is advertised through an 
Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) entry.  These rules help 
to avoid an occasional reset with IPMI service misconfiguration.
 
SOLUTION:
 
Solution 1:
 
·         Do not install the package “freeipmi-bmc-watchdog”.
 
Solution 2:
 
·         Install the package “freeipmi-bmc-watchdog”.
·         Disable service bmc-watchdog by manually selecting “chkconfig 
bmc-watchdog off” and then reboot.
Solution 3:
·         Install the RedHat newest package “freeipmi-1.2.1-6” which will 
resolve this issue.

Remotely rebooting a system over the iKVM in shared mode may result in the 
iKVM being disconnected
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
If a user launches the iKVM function and the system does a remote reboot, 
such as during a remote operating system installation, the iKVM will be 
disconnected and the user will have to log back in.

SOLUTION:
 
Remotely rebooting a system through the iKVM is only supported when using 
the dedicated management NIC port.  Remotely rebooting a system managed in 
shared mode is not supported and may cause a disconnection if the remote 
system is rebooted.
 
LIMITATIONS:
 
This is a hardware limitation of the shared NIC ports and is an industry 
issue.

This bug has been reported to the Novell bugzilla website at the following 
URL:
  
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=476821
 
The status is open and there are no plans at this time to resolve this 
issue. 
 
The root cause is that SUSE uses Gnome as its user default UI.  When Gnome 
establishes its session, an ID file will be created in the directory 
/tmp/.ICE-unix.  Normally, this ID should be the only one any established 
time, but sometimes Gnome creates an ID that has been created before.  An 
error, “Ice Listen For Connection did not return a local listener”, will 
be displayed.
 
SOLUTION:
 
The user should close the error message box and SUSE will run normally.  
If the user wants to avoid this error message, then move all the files 
under /tmp/.ICE-unix to another location.

TITLE: 
 
Heartbleed issue affects OpenSSL information disclosure in handling of TLS 
heartbeat extension packets
 
SYMPTOM:
 
An information disclosure flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS 
and DTLS Heartbeat Extension packets.  A malicious TLS or DTLS client or 
server could send a specially crafted TLS or DTLS Heartbeat packet to 
disclose a limited portion of memory per request from a connected client 
or server.
 
NOTE:  The disclosed portions of memory could potentially include 
sensitive information such as private keys.
 
This is as known as the Heartbleed bug.

TITLE:  
 
R110i only supports six SATA HDD’s when installing Linux instead of eight 
in AHCI mode
SYMPTOM:  
 
When SATA in RAID mode and sSATA is in AHCI mode (after being set in the 
BIOS setup menu), the Linux operating system cannot find eight drives/ODDs 
behind the sSATA controller when using LSI Software RAID and will only 
find six.

SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED WITH:
 
R110i for SATA controller is in RAID mode and sSATA controller is in AHCI 
mode.
 
OPERATING SYSTEMS: 
 
Linux 
 
SOLUTION:
 
None.
 
WORKAROUND:
 
Set the sSATA controller to IDE mode in the BIOS setup UI before Linux 
operating system installation.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
1.  Both the SATA controllers and sSATA controllers have three working 
modes, IDE, AHCI, and RAID in the BIOS setup UI.  The default setting is 
AHCI.
 
2.  The Linux kernel uses the AHCI driver to drive both the SATA and sSATA 
controllers when they work in AHCI mode or RAID mode.  The LSI software 
RAID driver requests to directly drive the SATA controller in RAID mode.  
The AHCI driver is loaded earlier than LSI software RAID driver.  The boot 
parameters below can be used to avoid having the AHCI driver be loaded 
into Linux kernel. 
 
–      For RHEL: “dd blacklist=ahci” 
–      For SUSE: “brokenmodule=ahci”, then press F6

Inconsistent Network Device Naming in RHEL6.5 and SLES11 SP3
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
With Consistent Network Device Naming (CNDN) enabled in RHEL6.5 or SLES11 
SP3, the network device naming shows an incorrect device name for some 
physical slots.  For example:
 
         Network adapter in slot 1 shows p2p3/p2p4 à should be p1p1/p1p2
         Network adapter in slot 3 shows p4p3/p4p4 à should be p3p1/p3p2

OPERATING SYSTEMS:
 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5
SUSE Enterprise Linux 11 Service Pack 3
 
SOLUTION:
 
This is the issue of the utility “biosdevname”.  The utility cannot 
recognize the network adapters correctly on multi-function PCIe root 
port.  Therefore, the network device name shows incorrect physical slot.  
It does not impact the functionality.  The network devices can be used 
normally. 
 
Lenovo has submitted a patch to the open source community and the patch 
has been accepted by the community.  The issue can be fixed by including 
the following patch:
