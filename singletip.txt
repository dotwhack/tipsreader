TITLE:  
 
HDD LED status is incorrect in the RAID100 Configuration User Interface 
during RAID volume rebuilds
 
SYMPTOM:  
 
On the Lenovo ThinkServer TD340 system, when the RAID volume is degraded 
and an HDD is undergoing a rebuild if the user is viewing the RAID100 
configuration User Interface (entered by pressing “Ctrl+M” during POST), 
the LEDs on the HDDs not being rebuilt will be solid on instead of 
blinking.  The HDD being rebuilt will function normally.  The amber LED 
will blink at 1Hz and the green LED will blink with I/O.

LIMITATIONS: 
 
This issue only exists in the RAID100 OPROM configuration User Interface.  
The HDD LEDs will function properly when the server is booted to an 
operating system.

None.
 
WORKAROUND:
 
The lights will show correctly when a server is booted to the operating 
system to do a RAID rebuild in the background.
